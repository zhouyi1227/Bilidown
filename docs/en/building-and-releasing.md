# Building and releasing

Install Python 3.12/3.13, Node 22, pnpm, Rust stable with clippy/rustfmt, the platform’s native Tauri prerequisites, and the pinned FFmpeg build.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pnpm --dir frontend install --frozen-lockfile
packaging\prepare-ffmpeg.ps1
packaging\build-desktop.ps1 -Python .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
packaging\build-portable.ps1 -Python .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

The portable script produces `dist/Bilidown-<version>-windows-x64-portable.zip` and a matching `.sha256` file. It contains the Tauri executable, its Python sidecar, portable-use instructions, an internal `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and license/source notices. After `build-desktop.ps1`, pass `-SkipBuild` to reuse the compiled Windows executable and sidecar.

On Apple Silicon macOS, run `prepare-ffmpeg-macos.sh` and `build-desktop.sh`. The build creates the one-file Python sidecar first, then Tauri produces native Windows installers, a Windows portable ZIP, or a macOS DMG/app bundle. Builds must be native; they cannot be cross-compiled between Windows and macOS.

Stable macOS checks and release artifacts use the ARM64 `macos-26` runner. A non-blocking `xcode-27` job checks compilation against the preview SDK, but that runner still executes on macOS 26 and does not replace testing on a real macOS 27 machine. Release builds smoke-test both the packaged sidecar health endpoint and the complete `.app` startup before uploading artifacts.
